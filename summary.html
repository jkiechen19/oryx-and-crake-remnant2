                        <p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Jimmy shown himself to the Crakers, and one of the Craker asked, “Who are you?” in a very blunt way that would be considered rude and impolite in our world. Also, they were fascinated by his clothes and his facial hair.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Jimmy decided to shed his identity, and introduce himself as Snowman to the Crakers. Jimmy now doesn’t want to be called Jimmy or even Jim and especially Thickney. All Jimmy wanted was to just forget about his past and just focus on the present.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Jimmy explained to the Crakers that he was sent by Oryx and Crake, and told the Crakers that Oryx and Crake are busy doing things and cannot be seen. Snowman convinced the Crakers to move out of Paradise with him to a better place by telling them that Oryx and Crake wanted them to be in a place where they could eat. Snowman also told the Crakers that his skin was loose because that is the way it is when Crake made him and also said the feathers (hair) that is on him was given by Oryx.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>When Snowman and the Crakers were going to the seashore, they passed through the body of Oryx and Crake and while that was happening, Snowman never told the Crakers who the dead body was. Also while they were moving along, Snowman told the Craker that chaos was around here, but they didn’t have to worry because “Crake and Oryx are clearing away the chaos, for you – because they love you – but they haven’t quite finished yet.”</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Snowman shot a man and a woman who was asking for help, and told the Crakers that it was just a dream and explained all that the Crakers saw in a gentle way so as not to horrify them. When they arrived at the seashore, the Crakers told Snowman that the place is beautiful. Snowman told them that it is called home.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
                        <p>In remnant, the moment when Jimmy walked in and introduced himself as Snowman to the Crakers signals the transformation of character in a symbolic way. The adoption of the new name, “Snowman” shows how Jimmy is determined to change into a completely different person. Additionally, Jimmy not wanting to be called Thickney shows how he didn’t want to associate with anything that has to do with Extinctathon since it made him feel inferior because he was never good at the game while it was the opposite for Crake. Not being good at the game reminds Snowman how Crake is always better than Jimmy in every way shape and form.</p>
                        <p>Also, when Snowman told the Crakers that Crake was the Creator of them, the purpose is to get back at Crake for what he did by making him look godlike. Crake is a person who doesn’t believe in god and is also offended by the idea of god. Therefore, Snowman had decided to make Crake look like god for what he did to the world. In the scene when Snowman explained to the Crakers that “Crake and Oryx are clearing away the chaos” when they were fleeing Paradise and Snowman not wanting to review to the Crakers who the dead body of Crake and Oryx were also shows how Snowman is trying to make Crake look godlike.</p>
